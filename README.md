# PSF Posterior Density Estimation using RJMCMC

To see this code in action, open the jupyter notebook in google colab using the following url:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/qnano/rjmcmc3D/blob/master/colab_example_cspline.ipynb

Arbitrary PSF's can be analysed, based on the [SMAP](https://github.com/jries/SMAP) [cubic spline PSF](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4661) format.
